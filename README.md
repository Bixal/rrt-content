# Rapid Response Team Content

The purpose of this repo is to hold a variety of content that can be used for different purposes, including pulling into templates, hosting assets, and formatting as JSON.

## Content formats

Content will be organized in a variety of formats:

- Assets (like images or documents) can be hosted.
- Tabular data can be stored as CSV files.
- Rich text can be stored as markdown or HTML.

Both tabular data and rich text can be accessed via URLs using JSON so they can be available for different uses, including Jekyll templates or Figma files.
